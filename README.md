angularjs-meets-meteorjs
========================

A minimal example to get Meteor and AngularJS running.

I didn't find out yet how to get a github repo into a meteor project, so you have to do this:
- clone or download this repository
- create a meteor project with 'meteor create foo'
- throw away the contents of the directory 'foo'
- copy the github project folder contents into 'foo'
- start meteor

and it should work.
